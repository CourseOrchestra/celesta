== General Operation Sequence

Celesta initialization goes in several stages, which is illustrated by the log output:

[source]
----
Celesta ver. 7.2.4
Celesta pre-initialization: system settings reading...
done.
Celesta initialization: score parsing...
done.
Celesta initialization: database upgrade...
done.
----

1. During *system settings reading* Celesta analyses the <<basic_settings_section,setting configuration>>  state, checks if all mandatory settings are set and configured correctly.
If any errors are found the startup interrupts.

2. During *score parsing* all available *.sql files are read, their syntax is analysed and an internal database object model (score) is created.
The system collects information about grains, tables and fields from CelestaSQL scripts.
Checksums are calculated and versions are determined.
If syntax errors occur or CelestaSQL scripts are not consistent, the system startup halts at this stage.

3. *Automatic database migration*.

== Automatic Database Migration

At this stage the application server connects to the database and checks the existence of the `celesta.grains` system table.
If the table does not exist, it is created automatically (via `CREATE` command), but only in the following cases: 1) the database is completely empty; 2) `force.dbinitialize` parameter is set (to prevent "corruption" of existing non-empty databases if Celesta connects to them by mistake).
If an error occurs during celesta.grains table existence check / creation, a fatal error is generated and the system does not launch.

=== Determining if the Automatic Migration is Needed for a Grain (Schema)

Next the process repeats for all grains (schemas) available in the score and all grains available in `celesta.grains` (this excludes grains, declared with `WITH NO AUTOUPDATE` option in CelestaSQL script).

. If the grain exists in the score but not in `celesta.grains`, upgrade is executed by a CelestaSQL script (it is assumed that the corresponding tables may already exist in the database).

. If the grain exists in `celesta.grains` but not in the score, nothing happens.
Grains are never deleted from the database automatically as their tables may contain important information.
Instead, the data access classes are not created for such tables.

. If the grain exists both in `celesta.grains` and the score, Celesta looks up the corresponding entry in `celesta.grains` for the state, version, and checksum of the grain that was installed during the latest migration.
Then Celesta compares this information to the current grain version and checksum.
The grain state recorded in `celesta.grains` table may have one of the following values:

** *recover (3)* – proceed as if no entry exists (see p. 1);

** *lock (4)* – the structure of the current grain should not be upgraded, go to the next grain;

** *upgrading (1)* or *error (2)* – the process interrupts with an error prompt  “Cannot proceed with the database upgrade: there are grains not in 'ready', 'recover' or 'lock' state”;

** *ready (0)* – continue the process.

... If versions and checksums of the current and the previously installed grains match, nothing happens.
System assumes that the structure of the corresponding database schema is consistent with the current CelestaSQL script and reduces the time necessary to analyse the existing structure.

... If versions and checksums do not match: if the version is higher, upgrade is carried out regardless of the checksum.
If it is lower or the version is incompatible (see the version tags <<version_tags,operation logic description>>), the launch interrupts with an error prompt “Grain '...' version '...' is lower than / is inconsistent with database grain version '...' . Will not proceed with auto-upgrade.” regardless of the checksum.

... If versions match but the checksum does not, the score is upgraded.

=== Grain (Schema) Migration Procedure

If the algorithm leads the system to require a grain upgrade, the database structure and the data structure described in the CelestaSQL script start to synchronize.
All missing objects are created – tables, fields, keys, indices, views, etc.
Objects in need of alteration (e.g. field data types, field composition in the index or SQL view requests) are altered.
The system makes effort to have it done automatically and without any errors.
Sometimes it is possible in every scenario (e.g. when a SQL query of a view is changed or a field set of an index is changed), sometimes manual intervention and executing an _ad hoc_ script are unavoidable (see the https://dzone.com/articles/trouble-free-database-migration-idempotence-and-co[post] on idempotent migrations).
Errors at this stage lead to grain transition to an *error* state and demand manual intervention by a database administrator.

If an object is deleted from the CelestaSQL script, auto-migrator removes from the database only the stateless objects  (i.e. tables and fields are not auto-deleted and can be deleted manually in an _ad hoc_ migration script, external keys are deleted from the deleted fields) to prevent data lose.

== Total or Partial Disabling of Automatic Migration

Celesta features several methods to disable automatic migration:

* *at the level of the entire database* – using `skip.dbupdate` option in the <<basic_settings_section, settings>>;

* *at the schema level* – by setting its state in the <<celesta_grains_table,celesta.grains table>> to 4 or by declaring the `WITH NO AUTOUPDATE` option in the <<create_schema_statement,grain (schema) creation statement>>;

* *at the table level* – by declaring the <<celestasql_with_options,`WITH NO AUTOUPDATE` option>> in the table creation statement.
