//tag::triggers[]

Trigger is a (lambda) function, which is written by the solution developer.
It accepts a cursor instance as an argument and is attached to the cursor class.
It is automatically called during record insertion, deletion and modification.
Trigger type looks like this: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/function/Consumer.html[`Consumer<? super YourCursor>`].

When `insert()`, `update()` or `delete()` actions are performed, the system calls certain solution developer-defined pre- and post-triggers (performed, respectively, before and after modifying the data in the database).
This means there are six trigger types in total:

[cols="^1, ^1", options="header"]
|====
^.^|pre-triggers
^.^|post-triggers

|onPreInsert
|onPostInsert

|onPreUpdate
|onPostUpdate

|onPreDelete
|onPostDelete

|====

IMPORTANT: It often makes sense to use pre-triggers to perform certain action before the update is sent to the database.
Note that since `onPreInsert` trigger is executed before sending cursor contents to the database, values of fields with `DEFAULT` or `GETDATE()` properties are not filled in at the moment of its execution.
Assign a `null` value to them to automatically assign them with values computed by the database.
During the `onPostInsert` trigger execution these fields are already assigned.

It is convenient to use <<xrec_section,xRec objects>> in `onPreUpdate` triggers to determine exactly what fields are going to be modified in the table.
Using `xRec` in `onPreDelete` trigger does not make sense because by the time the trigger is called it becomes equal to the current buffer.

Tables may have any number of triggers of each type.
For every table triggers can be set with *static* `onPreInsert`, `onPreDelete` and other methods of cursor classes.
Defining triggers with static methods makes them "global", i.e. they get executed at every interaction with the table.

Since the trigger registration method requires specifying the {apidocs}ru/curs/celesta/Celesta.html[`Celesta`] class instance, it is convenient to use `@PostConstruct` method to register triggers in Spring applications:

[source,java]
----
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private ICelesta celesta;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init(){
        MyCursor.onPreInsert(celesta, c ->
                System.out.printf("Record %s is going to be inserted!%n", c.getId()));
    }

    . . .
}
----

The `MyCursor` code generated class has the following method:

[source,java]
----
public static void onPreInsert(ICelesta celesta, Consumer<? super MyCursor> cursorConsumer)
----

System cursors (from the {apidocs}ru/curs/celesta/syscursors/package-summary.html[`ru.curs.celesta.syscursors`] package) also support trigger registration.
