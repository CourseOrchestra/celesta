Celesta Maven plugin generates the code of data access classes on the basis of CelestaSQL scripts.
Adding this plugin is mandatory for projects using Celesta.

Usage example:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>ru.curs</groupId>
    <artifactId>celesta-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${celesta.version}</version>
    <configuration>
        <scores>
            <score>. . .</score>
        </scores>
        <testScores>
            <testScore>. . .</testScore>
        </testScores>
        <!-- unnecessary, true by default -->
        <snakeToCamel>true</snakeToCamel>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>gen-cursors</goal>
                <goal>gen-score-resources</goal>
                <goal>gen-test-cursors</goal>
                <goal>gen-test-score-resources</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>

Plugin configuration settings:

* `scores` – path to the project folders containing <<CelestaSQL>> scripts describing the working database.
By default the path is `src/main/celestasql`.
* `testScores` – path to the project folders containing <<CelestaSQL>> scripts describing the database, used only for <<celestaunit_section,unit testing>>.
By default the path is `src/test/celestasql`.
* `snakeToCamel` (boolean, true by default) – whether tables and fields named in "snake_case" in CelestaSQL should be transformed to "CamelCase" in <<data_accessors_section,data access classes>> in order to meet naming conventions in Java.

Celesta Maven Plugin executes the following operations:

1. Generates code for <<data_accessors_section,cursors>> based on <<CelestaSQL>>:

** During the `generate-sources` phase the cursors are generated from `scores` and optionally `score` folder to `target/generated-sources/celesta`;

** During the `generate-test-sources` phase – from `testScores` to `target/generated-test-sources/celesta`.

2. Copies CelestaSQL files to resources:

** During the `generate-resources` phase CelestaSQL files are copied from `scores` and optionally the `score` folder to `generated-resources/score`;

** During the `generate-test-resources` phase – from `testScores` to `generated-test-resources/score`.

3. Generates the `score.files` index containing the list of relative paths to .sql files in resources:

** During the `generate-resources` phase – to `generated-resources/score/score.files`;
** During the `generate-test-resources` phase – to `generated-test-resources/score/score.files`.

These files are used when running Celesta to find paths to all CelestaSQL files in .jar files on classpath.
