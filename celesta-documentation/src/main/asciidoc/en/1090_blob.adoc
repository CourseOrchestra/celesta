BLOB fields allow to store huge amounts of information in table cells, even entire files with documents.
Work with these fields using cursors is different from work with other field types.

. Cursor fields corresponding to BLOB fields have a {apidocs}ru/curs/celesta/dbutils/BLOB.html[`BLOB`] data type.

. There is only one way to receive an instance of a BLOB class and assign it to a cursor field: by calling a `calc<field ID>()` method in the cursor.
For example, if the BLOB field is named `foo`, the corresponding cursor method is named `calcfoo()` and the corresponding cursor field is assigned a value after this method is called.

. Unlike fields of other types, when a record is read with `get()`, `next()` or other similar methods, BLOB field values are not fetched from the database and are always assigned `null` instead.
A `calc...()` method is called to read a BLOB field.
If the cursor's primary key fields reference an existing record in the table, calling the `calc...()` causes reading BLOB contents from the database to RAM.
This is why `calc...()` should only be called when it is intended to read or modify BLOB contents.

. A corresponding cursor field is initialized by a {apidocs}ru/curs/celesta/dbutils/BLOB.html[`BLOB`] type object after calling a `calc<field name>()` method.
Methods for this object allow to read and modify its contents and are described below.
After modifying BLOB object contents, an `update()` or `insert()` method should be used.

. If BLOB must be deleted from the database and a `NULL` value assigned to the corresponding table field, a `setNull()` BLOB object method is used and then `update()` method is called.
Assigning a `null` value via a setter will not work, unlike with other field types, because the system will interpret it as if BLOB is not read from the database and `update()` will not change anything.

{apidocs}ru/curs/celesta/dbutils/BLOB.html[`BLOB`] class methods:

getInStream():: Returns a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html[`java.io.InputStream`] class instance allowing to read the cursor contents or `null` if the database table cell contains a NULL value.
This method can be called multiple times and a new stream reading the BLOB from the beginning is created each time.

getOutStream():: Deletes all BLOB data from the memory (if there were any) and creates a new instance of https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html[`java.io.OutputStream`], in which data for BLOB can be saved.
It is worth mentioning, that every `getOutStream()` method invocation deletes all data from the BLOB in the memory, even if nothing is going to be written into the resulting stream.
Another important thing is that this method modifies only the data in a BLOB in-memory representation, actual recording in the database is performed only after calling `insert()` or `update()` methods on the cursor.

setNull():: Sets a `NULL` value for BLOB.

isModified():: Returns `true`, if initial object data is modified using `getOutStream()` or `setNull()` calls.

size():: Returns the internal BLOB data size in bytes.

Examples of code for a BLOB field:

[source,java]
----
OrderLineCursor line = new LineCursor(context);
//Hereinafter line.dat is assumed to be a BLOB field
. . .
//Writing example
line.calcDat();
try(OutputStreamWriter osw = new OutputStreamWriter(
    line.getDat().getOutStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)){
    osw.append("hello, blob field!");
}
. . .
//Reading example
line.calcDat();
InputStream ins = line.getDat().getInStream();
//Keep in mind that the field may contain NULL
if (Objects.nonNull(ins)){
    try ( BufferedReader inr = new BufferedReader(
        new InputStreamReader(ins, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) {
        //BLOB field contents is sent to the console,
        //for example, 'hello, blob field!'
                System.out.println(inr.readLine());
    }
}
