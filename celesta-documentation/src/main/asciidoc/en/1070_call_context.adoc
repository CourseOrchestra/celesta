== Call Context Creation and Life Cycle
To meet the requirements for granting access rights and action logging, all operations are performed on behalf of a specific user, anonymous operations are impossible.
This is why Celesta code is executed in a certain context determined by a  ({apidocs}ru/curs/celesta/CallContext.html[`CallContext`]) class instance.

Call context contain user ID, while links between user IDs and roles determine granting access to tables and allow to log changes made on user's behalf.

Context calls are created at the controller level, where the ID of the user performing operations is assumed to be known (through a token sent to the query, digital signature or other means).

Context is created with a constructor

[source,java]
CallContext(String userId)

If there is no need to consider the user ID or grant rights to access the tables, a  {apidocs}ru/curs/celesta/SystemCallContext.html[`SystemCallContext`] subclass can be used, because its constructor does not require any parameters.
In this case, a "system user" context with full access to all tables is created.

Any context created in this way goes through the following life cycle:

 1. *Activation*.
An `activate(..)` method is called receiving a reference to a `Celesta` object and a name of an executed procedure.
At this moment an implicit transaction starts in the database and call execution time counting begins.
 2. *Calling a service method*.
Context is passed as a parameter to a service method and is used to create cursors.
 3. *Closing*.
A `close()` method is called committing the transaction and closing all open cursors and freeing all JDBC resources.

Developer *does not* usually need to manually activate and close contexts since Celesta framework performs it automatically.

* When using  https://github.com/CourseOrchestra/spring-boot-starter-celesta[Celesta Spring Boot starter], cursors are activated and closed when calling methods of services marked by
a `@CelestaTransaction` annotation.
So for the developer it is enough to pass a nonactivated context to them.
Proxy object created by Spring framework around a service class instance will activate and close context and roll back database transactions if an uncaught exception is thrown.

* When using <<celestaunit_section,CelestaUnit>>, an activated system context on the basis of Celesta running with a H2 database in an in-memory mode is passed to test methods' parameters of a `CallContext` type.
Context closing and commits/rollbacks are performed by CelestaUnit automatically "under the hood".

== Call Context Usage

Each method in the service layer using Celesta must have an argument of a  {apidocs}ru/curs/celesta/CallContext.html[`ru.curs.celesta.CallContext`] type.
Call context is intended to be an argument for cursor constructors,
but it also has a number of public methods and properties available, feasible to be used in a service method:

commit():: Commits the current transaction.
A need in this method occurs only in rare cases when data processing transaction should be split in several parts.
Usually it is not needed as transactions are committed automatically at the end of the procedure.

rollback():: Rolls back the current transaction.

getCelesta():: Gets a current instance of a Celesta object.
It can be further used to obtain score metadata.

getUserId():: Get an ID of the user on whose behalf the actions are performed.

getStartTime():: Gets a call context creation time (the Celesta procedure start time got with `System.currentTimeMillis()`).

getDurationNs():: Gets a call context duration in nanoseconds measured as a difference between values returned by `System.nanoTime()` calls.

getProcName():: Gets the name of the procedure called initially from the controller (for debugging).

getDBPid():: Gets PID (process identifier) of the current connection to the database (for debugging).
